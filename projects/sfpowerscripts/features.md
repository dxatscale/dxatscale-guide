# Features

## **Boost your Productivity!**

* Simple to use CLI commands that can be operated from your terminal

## **Don’t spend your days fighting YAML/Bash Scripts!**

* Enhance your sfdx-project.json to orchestrate validation, build and deployment, acting as source of truth for everything about a package.
* “Thou shall not leave sfdx-project.json” – Zero intervention required on your pipeline when you add or remove packages

## **Instantaneous CI Environments!**
