# Build & Quick Build

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/sGjTfAzdXiI" %}

**Build and its variant quickbuild** are commands builds packages in your build stage of the pipeline. These commands provide the following benefits

* Reduce time taken to build unlocked packages, by triggering the package creation commands in parallel provided dependencies are built &#x20;
* Reduce efforts in reducing maintenance of builds scripts, when you have multiple packages.

During **quickbuild**, unlocked packages are built without triggering dependency validation or code coverage check. however **build** commands generate fully validated packages that can be deployed to production (after promotion). Packages generated by **quickbuild** cannot be deployed to production.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using quickbuild, to generate packages upon every merge and then deploying the to your test org's. When you have tested successfully, you could use the build command to generate validated packages
{% endhint %}

Both Build & Quickbuild is equipped with a diffcheck functionality, which os enabled when one utilizes **diffcheck** flag, A comparison (using git diff) is made between the latest source code and the previous version of the package, defined by a tag that follows semantic versioning. If any difference is detected in the **package directory**, **package version** or **scratch org definition file** (applies to unlocked packages only), then the package will be created - otherwise, it is skipped.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note the build command should not be run concurrently. Ensure you design your pipeline in such a way that only one build stage is run at any given point in time. Running parallel build commands could result in package with incorrect dependencies.
{% endhint %}

## Determining Package to be built

These commands follow the order of the the packages as ordered in your sfdx-project.json. The commands also read your dependencies property, and then when triggered, will wait till all its dependencies are resolved, before triggering the package creation command. For eg: provided the followings packages

**Scenario 1 : Build All**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png>)

1. Trigger creation of package A &#x20;
2. Once A is completed, trigger creation of package B & C **,**using the version of A, created in step 1
3. Once C is completed, trigger creation of package&#x20;

**Scenario 2 : Build with diffCheck enabled on a package with no dependencies**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (50).png>)

In this scenario, where only a single package has changed and **diffCheck** is enabled, the build command will only trigger the creation of Package B

**Scenario 3 : Build with diffCheck enabled on changes in multiple packages**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png>)

In this scenario, where there are changes in multiple packages, say B & C, the build command will trigger these packages in parallel, as their dependent package A has not changed (hence fulfilled). Please note even though there is a change in C, package D will not be triggered, unless there is an explicit version change of version number (major.minor.patch) of package D

## **Versioning Packages**

Utilize the .NEXT and .LATEST for versioning the build number of unlocked packages. For Source and Data package, utilize the "**buildnumber"** flag and provide the build number from your CI/CD system

## **Ignoring Packages from being built**

Using the `ignoreOnStage:[ "build" ]` property on a package, causes the particular package to be skipped by the **build** command. Similarly you can use `ignoreOnStage:[ "quickbuild" ]` to skip packages in the quickbuild stage.
