```

* Create a new package (new name) with type as Org Dependent Unlocked Package

### Can I add an unlocked or managed package as a dependency to source package?

Yes, an unlocked package or managed package can be added as a dependency to source package. If these packages are not part of your repository, sfpowerscripts will automatically install it during prepare/validate. Other than that, source packages are not validated during build stage and assumed to meet all its dependencies during installation to an org.

### Can I add a source package as a dependency to unlocked package?

No, source package is a sfpowerscripts only construct. From a salesforce perspective, it's nothing more than metadata deployment, hence salesforce is unaware of such a package. Unlocked packages only allow any other unlocked (excluding org dependent unlocked) and managed package to be added as a dependency. All the dependency is validated during the build stage any incorrect dependency will result in error
