# Solution Overview

In order to configure DX@Scale with **GitLab**, there are a number of key features that need to be setup on the platform before executing the pipeline. Whether you are new to GitLab or have prior experience developing CI/CD for other software stacks on GitLab, this guide is meant to summarize the key configuration steps on the platform and use the templates provided in our [sample repository](https://github.com/dxatscale/dxatscale-template).

For a deeper dive on the platform, documentation is available on [GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com).

## Security Design

There are a number of security considerations that need to factored into the setup of your GitLab project and pipeline. The following list will walk you through some considerations as you use the template and customize your pipelines for deployments.

* [Project and group visibility](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/public\_access/public\_access.html#project-and-group-visibility) - GitLab allows **Owners** to set a project’s or group’s visibility as **Public**, **Internal**, **Private.** For most implementations, **Private** should be the preferred option.
* [Merge Request Approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin\_area/merge\_requests\_approvals.html#merge-request-approval-rules) - Approval rules can be defined for merge requests to limit who can merge to certain branches
* [Protected Branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected\_branches.html#protected-branches) - Permissions are fundamentally defined around the idea of having read or write permission to the repository and branches. To impose further restrictions on certain branches, they can be protected. At a minimum, the **main branch** should be protected and certain **releases branches** created from main should be candidates for protection.
* [Permission and Roles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html) - Users have different abilities depending on the role they have in a particular group or project. Review the structure of your team and confirm who to designate as **Maintainers** and who are primary **Developers**.
* [CI/CD Variable Types](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#cicd-variable-types) - Project, group and instance CI/CD variables can be **Variable** or **File** type. File type CI/CD variables are used in the template for storing [sfdxurl](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx\_cli\_reference.meta/sfdx\_cli\_reference/cli\_reference\_auth\_sfdxurl.htm) file as input for authentication to Salesforce instances. **Protect variable** and **Mask variable** should be reviewed for each variable defined in the project to ensure that variables masked in job logs and can only run on protected branches or tags.
* [Using external secrets in CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/) - Secrets represent sensitive information your CI job needs to complete work. This sensitive information can be items like API tokens, database credentials, or private keys. Secrets are sourced from your secrets provider.
* [Integrations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/overview.html) - Integrations allow you to integrate GitLab with other applications. Review current active integrations and determine which applications make sense to integrate to GitLab. [Webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#webhooks) can be used in GitLabs but Integrations are preferred.
* [Project Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project\_access\_tokens.html) - Creation and rotation of project access tokens should be reviewed for configuring access to the GitLab API and the project.
* [SSH Keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/index.html#gitlab-and-ssh-keys) and [Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal\_access\_tokens.html#personal-access-tokens) - Depending on security guidelines, each contributor to your project repository should create these to streamline secure access.

## Configuration File

The [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab\_ci\_yaml.html) template file is the primary configuration file used for executing continuous integration, delivery and deployment on the platform. This CI/CD configuration file exists by default in the root directory of your repository and controls pipeline execution of stages and jobs triggered from updates to the repository via merge requests/merges, scheduled executions, or manual execution of the pipeline.

## Pipeline Design

### Triggered Jobs

The diagram below depicts the various stages and jobs configured in the GitLab CI/CD configuration file .gitlab-ci.yml which incorporates the [sfpowerscripts orchestrator](https://sfpowerscripts.dxatscale.io/faq/orchestrator) and [sfpowerkit package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sfpowerkit#sfpowerkitpackagevalid) commands to manage your CI/CD process. The grouping of stages and jobs are split into merge requests, merges, and manual triggers of the pipeline.

### Scheduled and Manual Jobs

The diagram below highlights the [dxatscale-template](https://github.com/dxatscale/dxatscale-template) recommended scheduled jobs and manual job for Scratch Org Pool Management. The stages and jobs configured in the GitLab CI/CD configuration file .gitlab-ci.yml uses the sfpowerscripts prepare commands to build scratch org pools for Developer and CI Scratch Orgs. Additional schedule job for publishing metrics to your dashboard platform is provided as well.

## Dashboard Metrics

Metrics should be a key part of your DevOps process. It is through these metrics, one can drive continuous improvement of your delivery process.

The [dxatscale-template](https://github.com/dxatscale/dxatscale-template) includes sample [cicd-dashboard.json](https://github.com/dxatscale/dxatscale-template/tree/main/dashboards/NewRelic) file for NewRelic enables you to push StatsD metrics to the platform and monitor key metrics. Integration and setup of this is available in the Getting Started section.

The following variables are required to be setup in your project variables to push the metrics to New Relic.

* SFPOWERSCRIPTS\_NEWRELIC _(Optional)_
* SFPOWERSCRIPTS\_NEWRELIC\_API\_KEY _(Optional)_

Read more about Dashboards and Metrics [here](https://sfpowerscripts.dxatscale.io/faq/metrics-and-dashboards).

## Configuration Options

There are additional configurations for the GitLab Project that should be reviewed and configured to ensure it aligns with your internal IT policies.

* [Merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge\_requests/) - Merge method, merge options, merge checks, merge suggestions should be reviewed to determine preferred approaches such as **merge commits**, **deleting source branches** by default option, and allowing **squash commits** when merging.

{% hint style="info" %}
DX@Scale recommends [squash commits](https://docs.dxatscale.io/scm/branching-model/branching-conventions#commit-message) when merging to provide succinct release notes during change log creation.
{% endhint %}

* [Merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin\_area/merge\_requests\_approvals.html#merge-request-approval-rules) **\*\*- Merge request approval rules prevent users from overriding certain settings on the project level. Define the** number of approvals\*\* required for merging into specific branches and specify users or groups that are allowed to approve them in the approval rules.
* [Repository Settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/#repository) - A number of configurations for the repository can be reviewed and change such as default branches, [push rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/push\_rules/push\_rules.html), [protected branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected\_branches.html) and [protected tags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected\_tags.html). Limit the restrictions where possible to not create bottlenecks for the pipeline and developers.
* [CI/CD Settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) - [Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) can be configured to be shared or specified. [Environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected\_environments.html) can be setup for protection in the CI/CD.
* [Clean Scratch Org Pools](https://docs.dxatscale.io/environment/pooling-scratch-orgs) - The clean-pool stage in the [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) file can be split into separate stages to hand the deletion of unused developer scratch orgs and CI scratch orgs.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Releases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#releases) in GitLab are not used by the dxatscale-template as we leverage our own release management process through the sfpowerscripts orchestrator and package registry. We will revisit the potential use of this feature in GitLab in the future if there is a need.
{% endhint %}
