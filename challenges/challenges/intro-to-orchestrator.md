**Time to complete:** 20 minutes

## Background

Orchestrator was introduced as part of the December 2020 sfpowerscripts [Release 18](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/releases/tag/Release\_18). Previous to this, the sfpowerscripts structure was based around individual tasks, and putting them together to create a custom CICD pipeline. While you can still individualise your tasks, the sfpowerscripts orchestrator provides you with a set of commands which understand your package structure and 'Orchestrate' your CICD pipeline for you.

The orchestrator commands are built to be used through a CICD platform, but can also be used locally through the command line.
