# Intro

We have designed a series of hands-on challenges to get you up to speed on Salesforce DX and then ease you into the world of DX@Scale. This material can be utilized as an onboarding guide to help developers understand the concepts.

Hope it helps!



PS: You can skip this section if you are already familiar with Salesforce DX, Git and concepts of packaging. Head to [Get Started](broken-reference) to set up your DX@Scale Project
