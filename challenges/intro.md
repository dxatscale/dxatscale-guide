# Intro

We have designed a series of hands-on challenges to get you up to speed on Salesforce DX and then ease you into the world of DX@Scale. This material can be utilized as an onboarding guide to help developers understand the concepts.

Hope it helps!

If you are already familiar with Salesforce DX, Git and concepts of packaging, you can skip this section and get started with the [Reference Implementation ](../ci-cd/reference-implementation/)to set up your DX@Scale Project.
