# Refreshing Sandboxes

When refreshing sandboxes from production, care must be taken to address the following concerns, a [runbook](../development-practices/tracking-manual-steps.md) should be maintained which addresses the below areas. Also, care must be taken when refreshing sandboxes with license type partial copy and full copy as they have refresh dates associated. They should be scheduled along with the testing team to make the most out of it.

{% hint style="success" %}
A sandbox could be refreshed at any point in time, provided your runbook is accurate and well defined

* **Users**
  * When sandbox is created, typically all users email address get suffixed with **.invalid** to prevent emails from being sent to actual users. This activity is automatically initiated by the Salesforce refresh process. Some users such as developers or admins would need to have their email reset and this can only be done by the user who initiated the refresh of the sandbox.
  * For some managed packages, additional licenses may need to be assigned using Permission Sets in order for users to use the application.
* **Single Sign-On**
  * Check whether there is a need to turn off SSO (Single Sign-On) in all profiles if the refreshed org is not to be set up with SSO.
  * Update the SSO Delegated URL in case the refresh org needs to be set up with SSO.
  * Check the end-point URLs In case of any SSO applications (outbound messages etc.)
* **Custom Settings**
  * Custom Settings will point to the data available in production. It has to be reset to non-prod values if necessary. Ensure that all managed package custom settings (if applicable) are updated to non-production instances as well to avoid pointing to the wrong environment.
* **Custom Metadata**
  * Custom Metadata values that point to production values will need to updated as well. Using the **aliasifed** source packages will aid in updating these values to the non-production instances.
* **Workflows**
  * From Address of Workflows will be reset to production
* **Emails**
  * DX@Scale practice is to use different From Email address using "Organization-Wide Email Addresses" setting for each sandbox. This can be done using **aliasifed** source packages. This package could be redeployed after a refresh
  * Remove/Change the additional email addresses e.g "cc" fields (which are mostly real users), for workflows (email alerts).
  * Update Email Links in Email templates from [https://login.salesforce.com](https://login.salesforce.com) to [https://test](https://test) [salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com)
  * Mask Email type fields from Lead, Case, Contact, Opportunity objects (This list will depend upon the most used Objects in the respective project).
  * Check If Queue(s) have any email address from non-production
  * Email deliverability usually after refresh it reflects “**System Only Email**” instead of “**All Email**”
* **Others**
  * Check for the site URLs which might be pointing to production rather than non production environments such as Remote Site Settings.
  * Reconfiguration of Connected-Apps with non-prod cert which will be required for the JWT etc. based on project requirements
  * Update the pipelines with new keys if the environment is connected to the CI/CD pipelines.
  * Community publish (if applicable)
  * Execute Post Steps as per the project requirements, since the Dev/Dev-Pro sandboxes will have only metadata, to bring the env to shape and make available for Devs/Testers, this step will be required
  * Transaction Security Policies may have to be updated to reflect lower sandbox notifications vs. Production
  * Load Test Data via data packages to enable Developers and Testers to use sandboxes with metadata only. For Full and Partial Sandboxes, ensure that data scrubbing of PII information is executed to protect data breaches.
