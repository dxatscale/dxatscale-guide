| Recommended development and testing environment             | Use scratch orgs to develop and test your unlocked packages.                                                             | Use a sandbox that contains the dependent metadata. Consider enabling Source Tracking in Sandboxes to develop your org-dependent unlocked package. Then, test the package in a sandbox org before installing it in your production org. | Use scratch orgs to develop and test your source packages.                                   | Use scratch orgs to develop and test your data packages.                                                                                                  |
| Code coverage requirement                                   | Before you can promote and release an unlocked package, the Apex code must meet a minimum 75% code coverage requirement. | We donâ€™t calculate code coverage, but we recommend that you ensure the Apex code in your package is well tested.                                                                                                                        | It doesn't have code coverage as it is only used for application-config.                     | It doesn't have code coverage as it is primarily intended for record-based configuration of managed package such as CPQ, Vlocity (Salesforce Industries). |
