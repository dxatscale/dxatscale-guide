# Monitoring Releases

Monitoring releases is a critical activity for DX@Scale practitioners. DX@Scale practitioners utilize multiple dashboards to understand the various attributes of a release and how the pipelines can be further optimized for realizing further value.

DX@Scale practitioners utilize metrics emitted from sfpowerscripts to track the following attributes of a release

| Metric                                                          | Description                                                               | Service Level Objective (SLO)                                                                         | SLI |

{% hint style="info" %}
DX@Scale practitioners follow a concept of deployment budget, where a maximum time is set for a release to production. This is an inherent SLO for the team to focus on and the time of deployment should be below this mark. If any deployment exceeds the allocated budget, the team should discuss various approaches and plans to mitigate it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If a release is retried more than 3 times to an environment due to a failure, the release should be marked as a failed release (even if the release succeeds in the 4th attempt) and the team should do a root cause analysis of the issue and methods to mitigate should be addressed as a priority before attempting the next release.
